# UI/UX Design Project – E-commerce Product Page (Week 2)

## Overview

This project is part of a UI/UX design internship and focuses on creating a high-fidelity e-commerce product page interface. The task was to design a product detail page that is both visually appealing and functionally user-friendly across desktop and mobile platforms.

The objective was to showcase a product — in this case, the Apple iPhone 16 — along with all essential shopping elements such as name, images, price, options (color, storage), product highlights, and action buttons, while applying responsive design principles and user-centered layout techniques.

## Project Context

This design aligns with the Week 2 prompt of the UI/UX internship, which asked for:

- A well-structured product page layout
- Sections for header, product media, descriptions, price, and call-to-action
- Clear visual hierarchy and clean typography
- Responsiveness across screen sizes
- Basic prototyping and interactive UI elements

## Key Features Implemented

- Prominent display of product name, rating, pricing, and storage variants
- Interactive product information including features like A18 chip, enhanced camera, and Apple Intelligence
- User review section with real customer feedback
- Call-to-action buttons: Add to Cart and Buy Now
- Additional recommended products
- Footer with navigation and company information

## Design Goals

- Create a clean, realistic layout that mirrors popular e-commerce platforms
- Apply consistent spacing, alignment, and typography for clarity and flow
- Focus on a user-first approach, especially for mobile usability
- Maintain brand aesthetics appropriate for a tech product

## Tools Used

- Figma – For wireframing, high-fidelity design, and prototyping
- Google Fonts – For clean, web-safe typography
- Visual UI libraries – For alignment with modern e-commerce patterns

## Concepts Applied

- **Wireframing and Prototyping** – Sketching the layout and creating a clickable design
- **Visual Hierarchy** – Emphasizing critical elements like product image and price
- **Responsive Design** – Structuring content to adapt across devices
- **User Flow** – Guiding users from product awareness to action
- **Call-to-Action Design** – Highlighting the primary next steps (Buy/Add to Cart)

## Deliverables

- `Week_2.fig` – Source design file (editable in Figma)
- `Week__2.pdf` – Static preview of the design for quick viewing
- `week2Q.pdf` – Project brief with internship guidelines

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundational e-commerce design built on essential UI/UX principles. It combines practical layout skills with a real-world scenario, reinforcing the importance of structure, clarity, and interactivity in product design. This experience is valuable for designing scalable product pages and future modules such as cart and checkout systems.
